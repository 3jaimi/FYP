# FYP
final year's project repo
To run the project, run fypNotebook on Google Colab to get the backend and the Interface.py file to get the frontend. You will need the datasets and the file structure on Onedrive to simulate results. I recommend contacting me at alojaimiali@gmail.com to get the access token and mount OneDrive. Check fyp.yml to get the required packages.
